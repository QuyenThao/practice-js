/**
 * You are given two strings and you have to find an index of the second occurrence of the second string in the first one.
 * Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims". Itâ€™s easy to 
 * find its first occurrence with a function indexOf which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims" 
 * and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0. But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and that 
 * means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.
 * Input: Two strings.
 * Output: Int or undefined
