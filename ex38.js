/**
 * You are given an array of numbers (floats). You should find the difference between the maximum and minimum element. 
 * Your function should be able to handle an undefined amount of arguments. For an empty argument list, the function 
 * should return 0.Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions. So we 
 * should check the result with Â±0.001 precision.Think about how to work with an arbitrary number of arguments. 
 * Input: An arbitrary number of arguments as numbers (int, float).
 * Output: The difference between maximum and minimum as a number (int, float).
