/**
 * After reading this fragment Nicola wants to build his own "Humpty Dumpty". As a basis he chooses the spheroid (read more about it on Wikipedia). 
 * We know the height and width (in inches) for this spheroid. For the job at hand, Nikola needs to know how much material is required.
 * You can help him and create a function to calculate the volume (cubic inches) and the surface area (square inches).
 * Tips: Be careful with sin-1x -- itâ€™s an arcsin.
 * Input: Two arguments. The height and width as integers.
 * Output: The volume and surface area as a list of floats. The results should be accurate to two decimals.
