/**
 * Nicola likes to categorize all sorts of things. He categorized a series of numbers and as the result of his efforts, 
 * a simple sequence of numbers became a deeply-nested list. Sophia and Stephan don't really understand his organization 
 * and need to figure out what it all means. They need your help to understand Nikolas crazy list.There is a list which 
 * contains integers or other nested lists which may contain yet more lists and integers which thenâ€¦ you get the idea. 
 * You should put all of the integer values into one flat list. The order should be as it was in the original list with
 *  string representation from left to right.We need to hide this program from Nikola by keeping it small and easy to hide.
 *  Because of this, your code should be shorter than 140 characters (with whitespaces).
 * Input data: A nested list with integers.
 * Output data: The one-dimensional list with integers.
